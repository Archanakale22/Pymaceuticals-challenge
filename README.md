The boxplot analysis of four treatments shows that Capomulin and Ramicane lead to smaller tumors compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. A correlation exists between mouse weight and average tumor volume, with larger mice having larger tumors. The distribution of gender among treated mice is nearly equal, with 51% males and 49% females, and gender does not seem to influence tumor volume.
